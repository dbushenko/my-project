The module provides the functions bound to the keys:
1) C-<F9> opens a project file.
2) <F2> generates the tags for the project and visits the tags table.
3) <F7> quickly finds a file in the project.

Install
1) Copy the file my-project.el to $HOME/.emacs.d
2) Add the following to your .emacs: (load-file "~/.emacs.d/my-proj.el")

Usage
Create 'project.el' in the project's root directory like this:
(defproject "My project"               ; Name of the project
  :root-dir "/root/dir"                ; Root directory of the project
  :sources "*.java"                    ; The file extension for etags
  :find-file '("*.java *.html *.css")  ; The file extension (one or more) for finding files. May be a string or a list of strings.
  :exclude "(SNAPSHOT)|(generated)")   ; The grep regexp for files and directories to exclude from search.

Run C-<F9> to load your project file.
